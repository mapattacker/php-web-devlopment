# File Transfer Protocol

File Transfer Protocol or FTP, allows you to access and transfer files to and fro your local and web server in production. [FileZila](https://filezilla-project.org) is one of the popular FTP software that is available among Windows, Mac and Linux. Personally for Windows, I usually prefer [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) for its cleaner interface.

We will need to store the credentials of our web hosting connection at **site manager**, by clicking the top left icon. Click on the **new site** button to create a new site, and enter the **host**, **username** and **password** for your web host.
