For that, we can install XAMPP , a web server stack consisting of PHP, MariaDB and Apache Server. It is available in Windows, Mac and Linux. Start Up After launching the app, at the General tab, click Start to start the XAMPP virtual machine. Then we can go to the Service tab and start the required services. Enable Remote Access to phpMyAdmin To access phpMyAdmin , a browser admin service for MySQL/MariaDB, at the General tab, click Go to Application . This opens a browser where the top right tab goes to it. However, on first launch, access to it is blocked by default. Steps to unblock is shown at the HOW-TO Guide tab at the same page. Essentially, we need go into the VM to change some config files. This can be done at the General tab, Open Terminal . Within the terminal, install an editor like nano. apt-get update apt-get install nano Creating a Database To create a database in MySQL, we click on the tab Database . Create a database name and click Create . The database can be accessed at the left panel. If we want to load all the data from another MySQL database, let's say from your production server, we can go to the Export tab (make sure you select your database first at the left panel first), and export the tables creation, as well as all the data within each table in SQL. To load them in your new database in your local server, we can either click on the Import tab and load that SQL in; or copy the entire SQL script you exported and go to the SQL tab and paste the script in.","title":"XAMPP"},{"location":"xampp/#xampp-development-environment","text":"PHP is a server side language, so we can only see how it runs when we start the local server.
