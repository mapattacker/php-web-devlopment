# Development Environment

PHP is a server side language, so we can only see how it runs when we start the local server. For that, we can install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), a web server stack consisting of PHP, MariaDB and Apache Server.

It is available in Windows, Mac and Linux.
