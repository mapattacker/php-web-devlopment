It is contained within the file sitemap.xml What It Is In its simplest form, a Sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs for a site along with additional metadata about each URL (when it was last updated, how often it usually changes, and how important it is, relative to other URLs in the site) so that search engines can more intelligently crawl the site. Web crawlers usually discover pages from links within the site and from other sites. Sitemaps supplement this data to allow crawlers that support Sitemaps to pick up all URLs in the Sitemap and learn about those URLs using the associated metadata. Using the Sitemap protocol does not guarantee that web pages are included in search engines, but provides hints for web crawlers to do a better job of crawling your site. Sample Sitemap Below is a sample sitemap.xml file. There are 3 optional tags: lastmod , changefreq and priority . <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <urlset xmlns= \"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\" > <url> <loc> http://www.example.com/ </loc> <lastmod> 2005-01-01 </lastmod> <changefreq> monthly </changefreq> <priority> 0.8 </priority> </url> <url> <loc> http://www.example.com/catalog?item=12 &amp; desc=vacation_hawaii </loc> <changefreq> weekly </changefreq> </url> <url> <loc> http://www.example.com/catalog?item=73 &amp; desc=vacation_new_zealand </loc> <lastmod> 2004-12-23 </lastmod> <changefreq> weekly </changefreq> </url> <url> <loc> http://www.example.com/catalog?item=74 &amp; desc=vacation_newfoundland </loc> <lastmod> 2004-12-23T18:00:15+00:00 </lastmod> <priority> 0.3 </priority> </url> <url> <loc> http://www.example.com/catalog?item=83 &amp; desc=vacation_usa </loc> <lastmod> 2004-11-23 </lastmod> </url> </urlset> Submitting the Sitemap Google is the most dominate search engine in world, so it is a must to submit your sitemap to it.

For that, we can install XAMPP , a web server stack consisting of PHP, MariaDB and Apache Server. It is available in Windows, Mac and Linux. Start Up After launching the app, at the General tab, click Start to start the XAMPP virtual machine. Then we can go to the Service tab and start the required services. We can choose to mount the volume, at the Volume tab so that we can access and add folders and files inside. Enable Remote Access to phpMyAdmin To access phpMyAdmin , a browser admin service for MySQL/MariaDB, at the General tab, click Go to Application . This opens a browser where the top right tab goes to it. However, on first launch, access to it is blocked by default. Steps to unblock is shown at the HOW-TO Guide tab at the same page. Essentially, we need go into the VM to change some config files. This can be done at the General tab, Open Terminal . Within the terminal, install an editor like nano. Note if you mount the volume, you can directly access the file in your own terminal. apt-get update apt-get install nano Creating a Database To create a database in MySQL, we click on the tab Database . Create a database name and click Create . The database can be accessed at the left panel. If we want to load all the data from another MySQL database, let's say from your production server, we can go to the Export tab (make sure you select your database first at the left panel first), and export the tables creation, as well as all the data within each table in SQL. To load them in your new database in your local server, we can either click on the Import tab and load that SQL in; or copy the entire SQL script you exported and go to the SQL tab and paste the script in. Launching your Website After mounting your volume, enter the directory and go into the folder htdocs ; this is where all your web files are read from in your browser. You can dump your entire folder of website here. To access it use the IP Address indicated at the General tab of XAMPP app, together with your folder name you place in the htdocs directory, E.g. https://192.168.64.3/uforest. It should load if it has a index.html or index.php inside. There might be some browser security warnings, but you can ignore them since you know that you are loading your own website.
